<p class="ex1">
In this experiment you are going to see dialogues between Anne and Bob, who are discussing pictures. Each picture shows a number of colored shapes. There are three possible shapes:
</p>
<table class='center'>
<tr>
<td align="center"><i>Square</b></i></td>
<td align="center"><i>Circle</b></i></td>
<td align="center"><i>Triangle</b></i></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"><div class='sx'></div></td>
<td align="center"><div class='cb'></div></td>
<td align="center"><div class='ty'></div></td>
</tr></table>

<p>
<b>However, only Bob can see the pictures, Ann cannot. So Anne is always asking Bob about what he sees.</b>
</p>
<p>
You will first see a dialogue between Anne and Bob: Anne asks a question about the shapes, and Bob answers. You should read this dialogue, then press a key to continue. On the next screen, you will see the picture Anne and Bob were talking about. Your task is to decide whether Bob’s answer is a good description of the picture, given Anne’s question. You will have to press 1 for “good description” and 0 for “not good”.
</p>
<p>
We are interested in your spontaneous responses, so don't think too long before answering.
</p>
<p>
The experiment begins with a few practice trials to familiarize you with the tasks. The practice trials are not about the same shapes.
